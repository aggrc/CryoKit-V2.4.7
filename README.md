Efforts in development of germplasm repositories to preserve genetic resources of aquatic species are impeded globally by a lack of standardized, inexpensive, reproducible, and portable cryopreservation technologies.

The CryoKit is a 3-D printable device that supports reproducible cryopreservation with standard cooling rates (5 to 35Â°C/min). The CryoKit accommodates French straws (0.25 and 0.5-mL) and cryopreservation vials (0.5 and 2-mL).The CryoKit can be used with a standard Styrofoam container that holds liquid nitrogen for on-site sperm cryopreservation for aquatic species and is distributed as open hardware.

Developed by the Aquatic Germplasm and Genetic Resources Center (AGGRC) at the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center. The CryoKit was designed by Brittany Ratliff, E Hu, Bill Childress, Victoria Byrd, Yue Liu, Terrence Tiersch, and colleagues, in partnership with the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) and USDA National Animal Germplasm Program (NAGP). This work was funded in part by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Program (ORIP). This device is part of a multi-year project to develop a series of open hardware to support development of standardized and reproducible tools for the research communities that use aquatic models to study human diseases.
